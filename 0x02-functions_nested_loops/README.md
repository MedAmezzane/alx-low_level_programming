# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX**. It aims to learn about header files, functions, loops and nested loops in **C language**.

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash 5.0.17(1)
* C files are compiled using gcc 9.4.0
* C files are written according to the [Betty](https://github.com/alx-tools/Betty) style
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
