# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX**. It aims to learn more about header files, functions, loops and nested loops in **C language**.

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash 5.0.17(1)
* C files are compiled using gcc 9.4.0
* C files are written according to the [Betty](https://github.com/alx-tools/Betty) style
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS


## Tasks

### Mandatory tasks


0. [isupper](./0-isupper.c): C function that checks for uppercase characters. Returns
  `1` if the character is uppercase and `0` otherwise.

1. [isdigit](./1-isdigit.c): C function that checks for a digit (`0` through `9`). Returns `1` if the character is a digit and `0` otherwise.

2. [Collaboration is multiplication](./2-mul.c): C function that multiplies two integers and returns the result.

3. [The numbers speak for themselves](./3-print_numbers.c): C function that prints the numbers `0` to `9`, followed by a new line, only using `_putchar` twice.

4. [I believe in numbers and signs](./4-print_most_numbers.c): C function that prints the numbers
  `0` to `9` except for `2` and `4`, followed by a new line, only using `_putchar` twice.

5. [Numbers constitute the only universal language](./5-more_numbers.c): C function that prints the numbers `0` to `14`, followed by a new line, ten times, only using `_putchar` three times.

6. [The shortest distance between two points is a straight line](./6-print_line.c): C function that draws a straight line in the terminal using the character `_`, followed by a new line.
      + If the function receives length input of zero or less, only a new line is printed.

7. [I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe](./7-print_diagonal.c): C function that draws a diagonal line in the terminal using the `\` character, followed by a new line.
      + If the function receives length input of zero or less, only a new line is printed.

8. [You are so much sunshine in every square inch](./8-print_square.c): C function that prints a square using the `#` character, followed by a new line.
      + If the function receives size input of zero or less, only a new line is printed.

9. [Fizz_Buzz](./9-fizz_buzz.c): C program that prints the numbers from `1` to `100`, but for multiples of three, `Fizz` is printed instead of the number, for multiples of five, `Buzz`, and for multiples of both three and five, `FizzBuzz`.
      + Each number or word is separated by a space.

10. [Triangles](./10-print_triangle.c): C function that prints a triangle using the `#` character, followed by a new line.
      + If the function receives size input of zero or less, only a new line is printed.
